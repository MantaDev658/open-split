# Open Split

A self-hosted, open-source expense splitting app. Track shared costs, manage groups, simplify debts, and settle up — without sending your data to a third party.

---

## Features

- **JWT authentication** — stateless auth via signed tokens; no session storage
- **Group management** — create groups, add/remove members with outstanding-balance guards
- **Four split strategies** — even, exact, percentage, and proportional shares
- **Penny-perfect math** — a custom `money` engine distributes remainders deterministically; no floating-point drift
- **Debt simplification** — greedy algorithm reduces N bilateral debts to the minimum number of transactions
- **Audit log** — every mutation is recorded per group with actor and timestamp
- **Cursor-based pagination** — all list endpoints paginated with `?limit` and `?cursor`
- **Retro UI** — Windows 95 design system: beveled borders, navy title bars, tiled desktop background
- **CSV CLI** — standalone binary for offline expense parsing from a ledger file

---

## Architecture

Go workspace monorepo. Two modules, two binaries, one SvelteKit SPA.

```

Domain layer has no external dependencies. Infrastructure depends on domain, never the reverse.

## Prerequisites

**Backend**
- Go 1.21+
- Docker (for the local PostgreSQL instance)
- `make`
- `golang-migrate`: `make setup-migrate`
- `golangci-lint`: `make setup-lint`

**Frontend**
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

---

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opensplit.git
cd opensplit

# Install frontend dependencies
make frontend-install

# Start everything (Postgres + migrations + API + frontend dev server)
make dev
```

`make dev` starts Postgres, applies any pending migrations, and runs the API
(`localhost:8080`) and frontend dev server (`localhost:5173`) concurrently.
Ctrl+C stops both.

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the repo root (loaded automatically by the API):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | Secret used to sign and verify JWT tokens |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | No | Allowed CORS origin (default `*`; lock to your frontend URL in prod) |
| `PORT` | No | API listen port (default `8080`) |

Example `.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/opensplit?sslmode=disable
JWT_SECRET=change-me-in-production
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

---

## API Reference

All endpoints except `/auth/*` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Currency amounts are always in **cents** (integer). `$10.00` = `1000`.

Paginated endpoints accept `?limit=N` (default 20, max 100) and `?cursor=<RFC3339Nano>`. Responses include `"next_cursor"` when more pages exist.

### Auth

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/register` | Create a user account |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Authenticate and receive a JWT |

### Expenses

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/expenses` | Create an expense; payer is taken from the JWT |
| GET | `/expenses` | List expenses; filter by `?group_id=` |
| PUT | `/expenses/{id}` | Update an expense |
| DELETE | `/expenses/{id}` | Delete an expense |

### Balances & Settlements

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/balances` | Net balances and suggested settlements; filter by `?group_id=` |
| GET | `/friends/{user_id}/balances` | Bilateral friend balances for the authenticated user |
| POST | `/settlements` | Record a debt payment between two users |

### Users

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/users` | List all users |
| PUT | `/users/{id}` | Update display name |
| DELETE | `/users/{id}` | Soft-delete a user |

### Groups

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/groups` | Create a group; creator is taken from the JWT |
| GET | `/groups` | List groups for the authenticated user |
| PUT | `/groups/{id}` | Rename a group |
| DELETE | `/groups/{id}` | Delete a group |
| POST | `/groups/{id}/members` | Add a member |
| DELETE | `/groups/{id}/members/{user_id}` | Remove a member (blocked if outstanding balance) |
| GET | `/groups/{id}/activity` | Paginated audit log for a group |

### Request bodies

**POST /auth/register**
```json
{ "id": "alice", "display_name": "Alice", "password": "..." }
```

**POST /expenses**
```json
{
  "group_id": "optional-group-uuid",
  "description": "Dinner",
  "total_cents": 9000,
  "split_type": "EVEN",
  "splits": [{ "user_id": "alice" }, { "user_id": "bob" }]
}
```

**POST /settlements**
```json
{ "receiver_id": "bob", "amount_cents": 5000, "group_id": "optional" }
```

## Split Strategies

| Strategy | `split_type` | `splits` format |
|---|---|---|
| Even | `EVEN` | `[{"user_id": "alice"}, ...]` — total divided equally; remainders go to first |
| Exact | `EXACT` | `[{"user_id": "alice", "value": 2000}, ...]` — values must sum to `total_cents` |
| Percentage | `PERCENT` | `[{"user_id": "alice", "value": 25}, ...]` — values must sum to 100 |
| Shares | `SHARES` | `[{"user_id": "alice", "value": 2}, ...]` — proportional to share counts |

---

## Frontend

The frontend is a SvelteKit SPA built with Tailwind CSS and a Windows 95 design system. It compiles to static files (`apps/frontend/build/`) and can be served from any static host.

### Component library

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `Window` | Win95 window frame with navy gradient title bar |
| `Button` | Beveled button — variants: default, primary, danger, success |
| `Input` | Inset sunken text input |
| `Select` | Inset dropdown |
| `HRule` | 3D groove horizontal rule |
| `Marquee` | CSS-only scrolling announcement bar |
| `HitCounter` | Black/green monospace stat display |
| `Badge` | Pulsing label — variants: red, green, yellow, navy |
| `Toast` | Fixed system-tray notifications with auto-dismiss |
| `Nav` | Taskbar-style navigation bar with logout |

### Frontend development commands

```bash
make frontend-install   # install Bun dependencies
make frontend-dev       # start Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
make frontend-build     # type-check (svelte-check) + production build
make frontend-test      # run unit tests with Bun
make dev                # start everything (recommended)
```

The dev server proxies `/api/*` → `http://localhost:8080` to avoid CORS in development.

## CSV CLI

Parse a CSV ledger file offline and print settle-up instructions:

```bash
make run-cli
# or:
cd apps/backend && go run cmd/cli/main.go -file=../../test_expenses.csv
```

CSV format — one expense per row, minimum 7 columns:

```
Date,Description,Category,TotalCents,Payer,Strategy,Participants...
2026-04-01,Dinner,Food,9000,Alice,EVEN,Alice,Bob,Charlie
2026-04-02,Hotel,Lodging,30000,Charlie,EXACT,Alice:10000,Bob:10000,Charlie:10000
```

---

## Development

```bash
make check             # build + lint (run before every commit)
make test-unit         # unit tests with coverage
make test-race         # race detector
make test-fuzz         # 30s fuzz run on domain package
make test-integration  # postgres integration tests (requires TEST_DB_URL)
make frontend-test     # frontend unit tests
make migrate-up        # apply pending migrations
make migrate-down      # roll back last migration
```

CI runs the backend and frontend jobs in parallel. Both must pass before merging.
The linter (`golangci-lint`) enforces doc comments, error wrapping, and a no-shadow rule.

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. `make check` and `make frontend-build` must pass clean.
3. Include tests for any new behaviour.
4. Open a pull request — describe what changed and why.
